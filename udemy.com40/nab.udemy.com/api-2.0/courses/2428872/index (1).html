We designed the course to take your Kubernetes skills from first-time user to using K8s in production.</p><p>Updates are a thing!&nbsp;You can count on it. Kubernetes is a huge topic and constantly evolving. <strong>As a result, this course will get updated and evolve with it. </strong></p><p><strong>Just starting out with Kubernetes?</strong> Perfect. This course starts out assuming you're new to container orchestration.</p><p><em>[five stars] \"Because Bret knows, lives, breaths and loves his technology stack. The passion and belief always comes through in all of his courses which is why I&nbsp;will always recommend his work.\"&nbsp; </em>-- Steven Hunt, Udemy Student</p><p><strong>Already a Docker Mastery student and want to know what's different between the two courses?</strong>&nbsp;This course assumes you know Docker and dives deeper into Kubernetes and the community of tools around it. Unlike Docker Mastery, which starts with container 101 and takes you through a lot of tools like local development setups, docker-compose, registry, Docker Hub, Swarm basics, Kubernetes basics, and general Docker best practices... <strong>this course starts with Kubernetes 101 and has you learning and practicing each feature and workflow you'll need for running your own Kubernetes clusters</strong>, and like all my courses, it focuses on how to use those features with a DevOps mindset and workflow. </p><p><strong>BONUS:</strong>&nbsp;This course comes with Slack Chat, Discord Chat and monthly YouTube Live Q&amp;As with me!</p><p><em>\"...Bret is amazing. You can tell he knows exactly what he is talking about and enjoys helping others. I&nbsp;have never seen someone so involved with his user base as Bret. ...I&nbsp;would seriously buy any course the Bret puts out because I&nbsp;have no doubts that it will be excellent.\"&nbsp; -</em>-&nbsp;David Olson, Udemy Course Student </p><p><strong>Why should you learn from me? Why trust me to teach you the <em>best</em> ways to use Kubernetes? </strong>&nbsp; (Hi, I'm Bret, please allow me to talk about myself for a sec):</p><ul><li><p><strong>I'm A Practitioner. Welcome to the real world:</strong> I've got 20 years of sysadmin and developer&nbsp;experience, over 30 certifications, and have been exclusively focused on DevOps and the container ecosystem for my consulting clients and my own companies since Docker's early days. <strong>Learn from someone who's helped run thousands of containers across dozens of projects and organizations</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>I'm An Educator. Learn from someone who knows how to make a&nbsp;syllabus:</strong> I want to help you. People say I'm good at it. For the last few years, <strong>I've trained thousands of people on using Docker &amp;&nbsp;Kubernetes in workshops, conferences, and&nbsp;meetups. See me teach at events like DockerCon, O'Reilly Velocity, GOTO&nbsp;Conf, and Linux Open Source Summit</strong>. </p></li><li><p><strong>I Lead Communities. </strong>Also, I'm a Docker Captain, meaning that <strong>Docker Inc. thinks I know a thing or two about containers and that I do well in sharing it with others</strong>. In the real-world: I help run two local meetups in our fabulous tech community in Norfolk/Virginia Beach USA. I help online: usually in Slack, Discord, and&nbsp;Twitter, where I learn from and help others.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><em>\"This guy is out of this world. I love his patience and carefulness he puts in all of his lessons.\" </em>-- Evan Baird, Udemy Student </p><p><strong>Giving Back: a portion of my profit on this course will be donated to supporting open source and protecting our freedoms online!&nbsp;</strong>This course is only made possible by the amazing people creating open source. I'm standing on the shoulders of (open source) giants! Donations will be split between my favorite charities like Electronic Frontier Foundation and Free Software Foundation. Look them up. They're awesome!<br></p><p><strong>This is a living course and will be updated as Kubernetes features change.</strong></p><p>This course is designed to be fast at getting you started but also to get you deep into the \"why\" of things. Simply the fastest and best way to learn the latest container skills. Look at the scope of topics in the Session and see the breadth of skills you will learn.</p><p><strong>Also included is a private Slack Chat group with 40,000+ students and a Discord server with 12,000+&nbsp;members for getting help with this course</strong> and continuing your Docker and DevOps learning with help from myself and other students.</p><p><em>\"I am really loving your approach to training so far.
