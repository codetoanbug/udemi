00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.583
This course is based upon a

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.135
workshop that myself, Jérôme, and a lot of other people

3
00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:12.530
have been using in the open source community for years.

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.539
It started out as Docker, then it became Docker and Swarm.

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.960
Then it became Docker and Kubernetes.

6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.639
And so I've taken that, extended it to

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.640
add more information, and this

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.821
means that there are many people evolving this content,

9
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.488
which means you get the best of a bunch of different

10
00:00:28.503 --> 00:00:31.013
brains. So thank you to that community and for all the PRs

11
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.241
and open source help with that because there's so much here

12
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.830
to learn. But even this course can't be everything

13
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.169
you need to learn a tool. You're going to

14
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.631
have to spend some time practicing. You're going to need to

15
00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:45.118
research special issues per your setup, right, so

16
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.619
not everything is going to be in this course.

17
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.991
That's obvious, I guess, of any course.

18
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.189
I just want to say that upfront.

19
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.554
That's why we have the Slack community, Q&A, and all this

20
00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:55.760
other stuff. This will take practice and this

21
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.399
course isn't designed to teach you feature-by-feature like

22
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.400
some courses might. That probably

23
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.909
isn't the best way to learn. We're going to learn by

24
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.870
digging in and trying to solve problems.

25
00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.691
We're gonna deploy different applications.

26
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.222
We're gonna have one large project throughout this course,

27
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.241
but other small tools and utilities will be running.

28
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.753
That's going to hopefully help you learn the patterns and

29
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.291
the commands that you'll be using over and over.

30
00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:20.909
And to get started with this, you

31
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.069
don't need a ton of Docker experience.

32
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.269
You definitely need to understand Docker, know

33
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.433
how to run containers, know how to build them.

34
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.349
But you don't have to necessarily be a Docker guru.

35
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.573
You do need some command line skills.

36
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:36.591
You need to know some basics around command lines and Bash

37
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.746
shells and similar things, but you

38
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.822
probably already have some of that, if you're familiar with

39
00:01:41.823 --> 00:01:44.279
Docker and you've taken another course on it, like my

40
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.269
Docker Mastery course. We want to involve you

41
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.669
as much as possible, which is why when you see exercises

42
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.209
like this one, this

43
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.079
exercise is meant for you to do with me. Now, I'm going to

44
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.290
be doing it on the screen so you can always watch it if you

45
00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:01.349
want, but you're definitely not going to get the synapses

46
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.702
in your brain working unless you're typing these

47
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.961
commands. And the nice thing is, we'll provide enough

48
00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:09.719
installation options that you can even do this on an iPad

49
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.632
and a web browser, if you had to.

50
00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.241
But ideally, you're following these exercises.

51
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.860
Notice that it'll be the parts that are dashed outlined

52
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.997
with the keyboard logo.

53
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.582
That keyboard logo means you

54
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.116
should be typing this along with me.
