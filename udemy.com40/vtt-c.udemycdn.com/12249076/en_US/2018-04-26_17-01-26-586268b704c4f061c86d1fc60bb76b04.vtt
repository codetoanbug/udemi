00:01.000 --> 00:07.630
Well, hello and welcome to Norwalk, Albertine's course, working with use cases in this course, we're

00:07.630 --> 00:12.400
going to cover everything you need to write, create and develop use cases.

00:12.580 --> 00:17.140
And we'll spend a lot of time looking at how we model all kinds of real world business solutions using

00:17.140 --> 00:17.290
them.

00:17.770 --> 00:22.930
So we'll be talking about use cases and diagramming and modeling and use case components and all that

00:22.930 --> 00:24.730
good stuff that you can see in the course syllabus.

00:25.030 --> 00:29.470
And along the way you'll be doing quite a bit of use case development yourself, because that's the

00:29.470 --> 00:30.220
whole point, right?

00:30.730 --> 00:35.170
There will be many opportunities for you to test your knowledge with quizzes and assignments, and I'm

00:35.170 --> 00:36.910
going to urge you to put your effort into them.

00:37.330 --> 00:37.750
Why?

00:38.050 --> 00:40.210
Because that's how you integrate the knowledge.

00:40.240 --> 00:42.760
That's where you do the majority of the real learning.

00:43.740 --> 00:48.450
This course is designed for anyone with fundamental knowledge of business analysis, but usually consider

00:48.450 --> 00:49.770
this to be an intermediate course.

00:50.220 --> 00:55.560
If you don't know a business analysis is or what a project is or what requirements are, I'll encourage

00:55.560 --> 00:59.190
you to hold up and take our fundamentals of business analysis course first.

00:59.610 --> 01:01.200
After that, come back to this one.

01:02.140 --> 01:06.460
I also encourage you to drop me a line if you have any questions or if you run into any roadblocks,

01:06.730 --> 01:10.500
my email address is Dogherty at Norwalk, Aberdeen Dotcom.

01:11.020 --> 01:11.410
Sure.

01:11.410 --> 01:16.810
Do some Googling around for any quick answers, but don't hesitate to e-mail me or ask a question in

01:16.810 --> 01:17.380
the lectures.

01:18.160 --> 01:19.370
So let me introduce myself.

01:19.750 --> 01:20.860
My name is Don Hussie.

01:21.130 --> 01:25.900
I'm a managing director with Norwalk, Aberdeen, and I'll be your instructor and use case guru for

01:25.900 --> 01:26.860
the remainder of the course.

01:27.840 --> 01:33.000
Prior to founding Norwalk and I was senior vice president with the large global bank in that role,

01:33.000 --> 01:37.090
I ran their BA Center of Excellence and also managed teams of business analysts.

01:37.680 --> 01:42.900
I was really fortunate to have a very talented team of TBAs with a wide variety of experience and skills

01:43.110 --> 01:44.460
and problems and obstacles.

01:44.910 --> 01:49.260
And leading a diverse team like this has given me a good amount of insight into the problems that both

01:49.260 --> 01:51.910
new and experienced MBAs run into.

01:52.320 --> 01:56.280
I've managed MBAs, developed MBAs, interviewed MBAs, hired MBAs.

01:56.670 --> 01:59.070
And you're going to benefit from all that experience in this course?

02:00.110 --> 02:05.240
Prior to doing all this, I was a B.A myself and a top investment bank, I worked on a wide variety

02:05.240 --> 02:05.840
of projects.

02:06.220 --> 02:11.960
The majority were systems related, building in enhancing the software the stockbrokers used and other

02:11.960 --> 02:16.880
projects were oriented towards changing how the bank operated and if you didn't involve any technology

02:16.880 --> 02:17.140
at all.

02:17.480 --> 02:20.660
And along the way I wrote about probably a million use cases or so.

02:21.740 --> 02:26.690
So that's me now before we dive into the course itself, I'll tell you a little bit about the company

02:26.690 --> 02:28.830
I work for Norwalk, Aberdeen.

02:28.850 --> 02:33.290
We are a leading provider of training with a very specific focus.

02:34.010 --> 02:39.490
We do training and coaching in business analysis only because that's what we're really good at.

02:40.010 --> 02:44.780
And for this reason, you're going to get an education in real world business analysis in this course.

02:45.730 --> 02:52.660
There can be a tendency in training to give students information that is either theoretical or just

02:52.660 --> 02:55.810
not very realistic or relevant to the day to day work.

02:56.480 --> 03:02.350
We're going to skip all that unimportant stuff and teach you what you need to do the job in the real

03:02.350 --> 03:03.790
world that you work in today.

03:05.030 --> 03:07.940
So with that out of the way, let's get started with use cases.
