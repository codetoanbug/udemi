00:00.780 --> 00:03.420
Welcome to the complete web developer.

00:03.450 --> 00:04.860
Zero to Mastery.

00:05.010 --> 00:11.340
The only course you need to become a full stack developer, get hired and start your new career.

00:11.730 --> 00:18.060
I'm Andre, a senior software developer that has consulted and worked for some of the biggest tech firms,

00:18.060 --> 00:20.490
both in Toronto and Silicon Valley.

00:20.760 --> 00:27.570
I left my job last year to teach full time and show others how to succeed in this industry.

00:27.810 --> 00:33.570
And since then, 120,000 programmers have taken my courses.

00:33.960 --> 00:39.300
Some of my students actually work at companies like Google and Amazon.

00:39.960 --> 00:40.710
Seriously?

00:40.980 --> 00:42.450
Yes, seriously.

00:42.900 --> 00:45.120
You see, I've been in your shoes before.

00:45.180 --> 00:51.750
There's so much information out there on the Internet, so many courses, video tutorials, classes

00:51.750 --> 00:53.100
and books that you can read.

00:53.100 --> 00:56.700
But when you're just starting out, what do you pick?

00:56.820 --> 00:59.220
How do you know what course to follow?

00:59.550 --> 01:00.870
Who do you listen to?

01:01.170 --> 01:02.700
Should you do a boot camp?

01:03.000 --> 01:08.730
Everyone tells you their course is the one and well, I'm going to do the same thing.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.560
But before you leave, let me tell you why this is different.

01:14.040 --> 01:22.050
The thing is, most courses are outdated, teaching you less valuable skills like jQuery or PHP, or

01:22.050 --> 01:25.370
they talk about how web development is so easy.

01:25.380 --> 01:28.680
You just create a bunch of apps with pretty colors.

01:28.800 --> 01:35.370
It looks impressive to a beginner, but when you go to an interview at a company, they will find out

01:35.370 --> 01:41.700
who is a quality developer and who just copied some code from an online course with pretty colors.

01:42.030 --> 01:48.570
And then we have other courses that just don't cover the full spectrum of technologies that you actually

01:48.570 --> 01:51.510
need to become a well respected programmer.

01:51.840 --> 01:56.940
They only cover the easy things because the easy things are easy to teach.

01:57.450 --> 02:03.720
Now, in this course, we won't be taking any shortcuts, but we won't be wasting our time on skills

02:03.720 --> 02:05.100
that are outdated either.

02:05.550 --> 02:07.170
It's all about efficiency.

02:07.530 --> 02:14.880
If you value your time, everything in here is directly related to what you can do as a developer to

02:14.880 --> 02:17.680
jumpstart or grow into your career.

02:17.700 --> 02:24.060
You're going to learn real skills that are in demand right now and used by some of the biggest firms

02:24.060 --> 02:27.540
like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix.

02:27.570 --> 02:34.830
We'll go from understanding how the Internet works to building a final project together where we build

02:34.830 --> 02:43.260
an image recognition app by creating the front end with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and react a server with

02:43.260 --> 02:51.300
Node and Express and a secure database using post graphs all built from scratch by ourselves and releasing

02:51.300 --> 02:52.950
it to production online.

02:53.070 --> 02:56.010
And don't worry, you'll learn what all of these mean.

02:56.460 --> 03:00.990
I guarantee you no other course builds a complex app like this.

03:01.320 --> 03:05.130
This project on your portfolio will wow employers.

03:05.610 --> 03:07.800
This isn't just pretty colors, my friends.

03:08.400 --> 03:14.880
Now, along the way, we will build other projects together that you can put on your portfolio to impress

03:14.880 --> 03:16.260
your future employers.

03:16.320 --> 03:22.120
3 hours into this course, you will create a startup landing page that is actually on the Internet.

03:22.140 --> 03:26.760
We even build a personal portfolio to put your projects on.

03:27.120 --> 03:34.800
Now, when you enroll, you'll get lifetime access to hundreds of HD videos as well as exercises and

03:34.800 --> 03:36.120
portfolio projects.

03:36.120 --> 03:42.210
And I also update this course monthly because this is now my full time job.

03:42.210 --> 03:45.300
And when I say monthly, I mean monthly.

03:45.330 --> 03:50.970
Since this course launched, I've added over 10 hours of video and I continued to do so.

03:51.330 --> 03:57.690
But to be honest with you, the best part you'll get access to our online community that has thousands

03:57.690 --> 04:04.020
of developers chatting every day, helping each other out and doing monthly coding challenges to help

04:04.020 --> 04:05.760
you get through the course.

04:05.970 --> 04:10.230
I'm proud to say that we have the most active developer community.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.330
Remember, nobody is born a developer.

04:14.340 --> 04:16.170
We all started at zero.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.750
Nobody is good at anything at first.

04:18.780 --> 04:25.350
There was a time when Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos or even Bill Gates couldn't count to ten.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.380
You will struggle, you will make mistakes.

04:28.380 --> 04:32.430
But with each video, you will learn more and more each time.

04:32.430 --> 04:35.100
Make your brain just a little bit smarter.

04:35.100 --> 04:41.520
And I guarantee you that I will help you get there, wherever you are, wherever in the world you are.

04:41.550 --> 04:43.740
You can become a web developer.

04:43.860 --> 04:50.730
In fact, if this course does not do what it promises, we have a 30 day money back guarantee, no questions

04:50.730 --> 04:51.330
asked.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.980
Check out the next video for the course outline to see if this course is right for you.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.180
I'll see you inside.
